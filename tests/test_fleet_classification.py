"""Tests for owned-fleet classification (Stellaris 4.x + legacy saves).

Stellaris 4.x ("Pegasus") tags every fleet with a ``ship_class`` and dropped the
old ``station=yes`` marker, so starbases (``shipclass_starbase``) were being
counted as military fleets/ships. Classification must key off ``ship_class`` when
present and fall back to the legacy ``station``/``civilian``/military-power
heuristic for older saves.
