"""Classify a player's owned fleets as military, starbase, or civilian.

Stellaris 4.x ("Pegasus") tags every fleet with a ``ship_class`` (e.g.
``shipclass_military``, ``shipclass_starbase``, ``shipclass_science_ship``) and
no longer marks starbases with ``station=yes``. The old heuristic
(``station``/``civilian`` flags plus a military-power threshold) therefore
counted every starbase as a military fleet. Prefer the explicit ``ship_class``
when present; fall back to the legacy heuristic for older saves that lack it.
